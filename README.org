* What?
This is actually a [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][doom-emacs]] private module. I was feeling rather whimsical.
* Why?
[[https://github.com/HaoZeke/Dotfiles][My Dotfiles]], managed with the brilliant [[https://github.com/kobus-v-schoor/dotgit][dotgit]], was getting rather overwhelmed
with ~emacs~ commits. Also managing snippets with ~dotgit~ was not exactly
pleasant, since each symlink needed to be listed in the ~filelist~.
* How?
Well it just goes where ~doom~ expects config files.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone git@github.com:HaoZeke/dotBatcave $XDG_CONFIG_DIR/doom
#+END_SRC
* License
It is a personal configuration. So I guess the [[https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/][MIT license]] will do for now.
